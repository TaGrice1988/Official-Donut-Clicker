            <div class="lore"><p style="color:indigo ;">Fred is a baker who is absolutely devoted to the fine art of baking donuts. After years of pouring his heart and soul into his culinary craft he now plans on retiring from his business. However as a tribute to his love of baking he has requested that a website be made to memorialize his great passion; as both a way to fondly remember him and as a fun little game. Fred hopes that you enjoy this plucky little clicker almost as much as he loved creating donuts for everyone.</p>
